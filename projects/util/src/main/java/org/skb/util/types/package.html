SKB type library organised in the packages <code>api</code>, <code>atomic</code> and <code>util</code>. 

<p>
	The SKB type library is basically an implementation of the Composite Pattern as a data structure, similar to the way the DEN-ng information model uses this pattern.
	Similar to the well-known pattern (as defined by the Gang of Four), this implementation composes objects in a tree structure and provides methods to process the resulting 
	tree recursively.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Terminology:</b> The implementation uses the terms <code>api</code> <code>atomic</code> and <code>composite</code>. The <code>api</code> provides interface definitions
	for atomics and composites. The <code>atomic</code> captures all 'leafs' or 'entries' and provides implementations and wrappers of commonly used other classes, such as the 
	JAVA basic types, ANTLR classes and others.
</p>

<p>
	The sub-packages provide for all types that the SKB system uses.
	<ul>
  		<li><code>api</code>:<br />
			Contains the interfaces for the type hierarchy (TSBasea, TSAtomic and TSComposite) and some interfaces for specific types (i.e. TSMap, TSTable and TSTableRow).
		</li>
		<li><code>atomic</code>:<br />
			The atomic packages has two sub-packages. First, <code>antlr</code> provides compositions for the ANTLR class Token and the StringTemplate classes StringTemplate and StringTemplate Group.
			Second, <code>java</code> provides compositions for the basic Java types: Boolean, Byte, Double, Float, Integer, Long, Object, Short and String.
		</li> 
		<li><code>util</code>:<br />
			This package contains classes that are very similar to java.utils, such as array lists (for general OatAtomic types and for Strings, map (implementing a linked hash map),
			PDO (for a simple portable database object), property map (implementing a simple key/value map), table and table row, scope (implementing a utils class for scoped names)
			and STGManger (providing access to the string template manager of org.skb.utils). 
		</li>
	</ul>
