Adding ANTLR Ant Task (Building with ANTLR):
=============================================
Download the following from antlr.org:

 - Under File Sharing:
	ANTLR v3 task for Ant (antlr-task.zip)

 - Under Downloads:
	Complete ANTLR 3.3 Java binaries jar (antlr-3.3-complete.jar)

Then extract the antlr-task.zip, and copy the file ant-antlr3.jar
and antlr-3.3-complete.jar to the $ANT_HOME/lib directory. This
will allow the use of antlr ant task in the build system. Further
details on using it can be seen in the documentation (.pdf) in the
extracted zip folder.

================

1. Suck in the environment settings for a build
	$> . ./env.sh

2. Build a Distro

3. Run the demo
